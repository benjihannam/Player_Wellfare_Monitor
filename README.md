**Introductory Notes:**

The idea behind this library is to create an **easy to use** system for coaches and medical trainers on sports teams to use when **tracking the amount of wear and tear** that is being placed on their players' bodies. On top of this there is also the aim to be able to quickly and easily pull up relevant information regarding the injury status of the players, to enable the **coaches and trainers to make more informed decisions** about the fitness of their players.
